# Grant Process Post 1

While compiling the topic ideas, research, and written documents necessary for a grant proposal is in some ways challenging, establishing a plan for my own digital humanities (DH) project has been exciting. My plan has developed through the written abstract, collaboration with Dr. Stover, readings on successful DH projects and successful grant writing, research on DH mapping projects, and research on my topic. The combination of DH, an area new to me, and psychology, my area of study, drives my excitement for this project. My project abstract outlined my plan to create a travel map of William James, the Father of Psychology, visualizing the pattern in which the study of psychology spread. My research thus far has not so much changed my original vision presented in the abstract, but has expanded upon it.

As much of the research on successful grant writing has established, research is tedious but necessary. I have found this to be true in my experience, especially in regards to the Environmental Scan. Factors such as the novelty of DH projects, specifically those in the area of travel mapping, contribute greatly to the tediousness of research. A simple google search, or even database search, did not provide me with examples of DH travel mapping projects or literary analysis of such projects. I therefore had to delve deeper into search engines, reading through entire articles looking for some analyses of previously developed mapping projects. Eventually, I found success broadening my search, discovering a variety of different sources that could help develop an effective Environmental Scan. My Environmental Scan features a couple mapping projects of individual historical figures, a couple mapping projects that consider historical data, and some sources addressing the benefits of current and future mapping projects. The sources featured in my Environmental Scan are not all alike, but their common feature is relation to my project. 

As mentioned, the research completed for my project so far has served to expand upon the ideas originally presented in my abstract. I still imagine my project presenting the travels of William James through America and Europe with a DH map. My research has allowed me to access some of his papers, which expands my understanding of the ideas he spread through his travels. It also provides me with a better understanding of what materials I have access to regarding content for my map. Further, researching mapping projects for my Environmental Scan has allowed me to see that my project will not just pin point places where James traveled, but it will create a larger picture of the spread of psychology.

Research on mapping projects has also increased my understanding of how to create the map I envision. With one specific article, [Basics of Mapping for the Digital Humanities](https://sandbox.idre.ucla.edu/sandbox/basics-of-mapping-for-the-digital-humanities), I have begun informing myself of the different sources available to me. Because my knowledge of technology is slim, I originally thought I would create a map using [StoryMapJS](https://storymap.knightlab.com), but I am beginning to realize there are other options, such as [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) or [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/). I will continue researching different technologies available to determine which one will best serve my project.

Because my interests in William James escape the traditional understanding of the humanities, my project is different than most that exist. There are plenty of mapping projects in existence and, as sources state, mapping is becoming more popular because of its various educational benefits. However, there are only a handful of maps like mine that consider the journey of a single man or woman. I drew inspiration from two specific projects: *Mapping Isabella Bird: Geolocation & Unbeaten Tracks in Japan* (1880) and *Mapping Hemingway in Idaho*. I was inspired by the visual map of the project on Isabella Bird (Image 1) and by the complimentary descriptions of the pictured locations in the Hemingway map (Image 2).

While the lack of projects similar to mine served as a challenge when developing my Environmental Scan, it proves that my project is needed. When I first began learning about DH and researching DH projects for assignments in this course, I quickly realized that there was room for digital humanities to expand into different disciplines. I know the title of the discipline emphasizes the works within the **humanities** field, but my project will demonstrate that DH projects are beneficial elsewhere as well.
