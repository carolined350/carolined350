[The Spread of U.S. Slavery, 1790-1860](https://lincolnmullen.com/projects/slavery/) is a contribution to the study of history and digital humanities from [Lincoln Mullen](https://lincolnmullen.com), a professor of History at George Mason University. The project displays an interactive map of the enslaved population in the United States. It presents statistical information about the population of slaves, freed African Americans, and the total population in each county of the nation over the span of seven decades. 

A description of the technology used to create the project is lacking, however, the project director does provide a link to the available code on GitHub. The interactive map is neither a new display of GitHub’s capabilities nor a new display of the history of slavery, but it does succeed in allowing users to explore the data so to encourage the development of further historical arguments. 

The map is navigable and visually appealing even to someone with only modest knowledge of slavery history. However, because the project’s audience is limited to historians it lacks inclusivity.

The map is simply designed with practical features. An outline of the United States, along with the established states and territories, is presented for each ten year mark from 1790 to 1860. The slave counties are highlighted in colors that coordinate with the slave population of each area, distinguishable using the key. A drop-down menu allows the user to change the statistic displayed on the map, such as the enslaved population or the free population. Users can select a county (which also displays the statistics) to zoom into the county and the surrounding area. 

In naming a few particular strengths of the project, it effectively presents data for each county through the use of what I will refer to as hover boxes. A foggy transparent box, the transparency allowing users to view the entirety of the map while still distinguishing the information from the map visuals, appears when the user’s mouse hovers over a county. The box includes all the statistics for the specific county in both numerical fashion and percentages. While all the statistics are present, the statistics themselves hold little value to those outside of historical studies. 

The capabilities of the map through transitions additionally contribute to its success. The user can manipulate the timeline lain underneath the map or the drop-down menu at any time and no matter the state of the map (zoomed in or out). This is particularly functional because historians can remain zoomed in on a county while changing the year or statistic in view. 

Another strength of the project comes with the [introduction to the visualization](https://lincolnmullen.com/blog/mapping-the-spread-of-american-slavery/) page and the added explanation of census data. Through this added information, users develop a clear picture of where the map and it’s data originated. The current project is an alteration and expansion of a 1861 map that revealed the percentages of those enslaved in different counties at the time. The information included in this project was collected from the census from 1790 to 1860. While the typed version of all the data (presented underneath the map) is not readable for a novice because of code-like formatting, the presentation of the data may be beneficial to the historians the project was created for. 

As noted when discussing the project’s strengths, the project could reach a greater audience if certain areas were manipulated or expanded. For example, this project could benefit from a more detailed timeline. The current timeline only allows users to view the slavery statistics every ten years. The project could be more inclusive **and** informative if it included statistics for every five years, or even every year. Another great contributor to the lack of inclusivity is the limit of information. The project only displays the census data statistics. The project could reach a greater audience if it included additional information such as a description of relevant events occurring during any selected year. 

The Spread of U.S. Slavery, 1790-1860 is a well established project and like most projects, includes strengths and weaknesses. Adding a more detailed timeline and additional context to the existing functioning features would be beneficial. While such additions can be made to enhance the inclusivity of the project, the purpose for the project stated by the director, is certainly achieved.
