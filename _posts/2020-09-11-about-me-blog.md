# My name is Caroline Daniels...

...and I am a senior at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu) (CNU) in Newport News, VA. I am working towards a bachelor of arts in Psychology, and I love exploring interdisciplinary thought through the combination of my minors, Leadership Studies and Writing. 

I am **determined** to further my studies of psychology in a doctoral program for clinical psychology. I am actively developing my resume with a writing associateship for a Psychology Research Methods course and participation in undergraduate research. Headed by a CNU professor, I work with a small team of student researchers to produce data on the stigma surrounding mental health on college campuses. Our most recent project about the implicit support for stigma towards seeking help from a mental health professional was nominated for the Outstanding Professional Paper for the [Southeastern Psychological Association annual meeting](http://www.sepaonline.com) in April 2020. Unfortunately, we were unable to defend our research at the conference as planned. I hope to expand my laboratory experience with research on motivational types in adolescence and early adulthood.

After completing a doctorate, I hope to secure a job in higher education as a psychology professor and researcher. I am also interested in a career as a practicing psychologist-maybe I’ll create an opportunity to mesh both careers. I have lofty goals of giving a TED talk and writing a book someday, but we’ll see where life goes. 

Outside of my psychology bubble, I volunteer at [Riverside Regional Medical Center](https://www.riversideonline.com/rrmc/volunteer.cfm) in Newport News. I regularly work in the hospital’s outpatient infusion center where I assist the nurses and chat with patients receiving treatment. You can also frequently find me in the [Alice F. Randall Writing Center](https://cnu.edu/academicsuccess/) at CNU where I work to improve student’s writing skills. Through these positions I have learned the value of kindness, connection, and helping others!

My About Me Page wouldn't be complete without a mention of my favorite adventure buddy, Frankie. She's a 6 month old beagle boxer mix who holds a special place in my heart. She and I enjoy walking, hiking, and kayaking around my hometown in South Carolina!
