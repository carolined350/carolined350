# TEI Coding Reflection
In this project, I created a digital edition of a passage from Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s [“The Yellow Wall-paper.”](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/theliteratureofprescription/exhibitionAssets/digitalDocs/The-Yellow-Wall-Paper.pdf) The short story tells a tale about a middle aged woman in 1892 who experiences isolation and subordination from her husband because of mental health struggles. I coded a passage using XML (eXtensible Markup Language), and specifically TEI (Text Encoding Initiative). While this was my first experience using XML, the coding process proved relatively straightforward, especially with guidance from a pre-coding class exercise using Google Docs.

This project was a collaboration between students studying Digital Humanities, so I focused my attention on a single passage from the story, rather than the entire piece. I coded the first column of page 649, in which the main character describes the boredom of her everyday activities. My passage contained features that are key to the coding process, such as em-dashes, italicized words, and part of a quote.

Identifying the key elements of my passage was the first step in coding it. After reading the original periodical, I engaged with my passage through a [Google Doc.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pbbiJW4uFw8rmuTqAU-806Hntv6X5ikXXc8-zCATpAU/edit) This allowed me to get to know the text better and become familiar with the aspects that are important when coding. While practicing close reading of my passage on the Google Doc, I identified and marked the features that would later be coded. For my passage, this included the beginning of every new paragraph, a quote, italicized words, and em-dashes. Spending time with my text on Google Docs was extremely helpful. It forced me to get to know the contents of my passage and start the coding process before ever opening the XML software.

Because of the pre-coding class activity used for this project, coding in XML was straightforward. I experienced a brief learning curve in which I got acquainted with the features of XML. For instance, I learned coding for em-dashes and italicized words and the importance of closing all codes before closing a paragraph. Walking through the software for the first time in class allowed for acquisition of such knowledge. I was then able to apply these skills to properly code my passage. Without verbal and visual guidance in class, I have doubts that I would have figured out the software myself. 

The Google Doc and the class guidance was essential for my success in coding, but the repetition of my passage was also instrumental. Almost every sentence of my passage was its own paragraph, so I quickly learned how to properly code paragraphs. After coding all paragraphs, I simply had to add code for 2 italicized words and 2 em-dashes, along with one partial quote at the end of my text. Thankfully, I was able to insert these codes with no problems!

The simplicity of my passage, along with the step-by-step process and guidance, enabled me to have a good first experience with XML. The XML software was new to me but easy to use. I especially liked the “red for error” feature. It provided reassurance when coding properly and redirection when making mistakes. When I code again, I will be inclined to utilize XML software now that I have some experience and a Google Doc as a starting point.
