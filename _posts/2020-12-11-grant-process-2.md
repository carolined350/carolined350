# Grant Process Post 2

Writing a grant proposal takes a lot of work; I can say that from experience, now. My grant proposal is based on my mapping project, *William James’s Travel*.  The project seeks to map the cities to which William James, the founder of modern psychology, traveled. Because James’s works were the first to present psychological science, his travels represent the spread of psychology. The visualization of a digital map allows viewers to determine the pattern by which psychology first spread in Europe and America. While my project has not changed drastically since the original ideas in my proposals, my project has developed since the start. 

In my last [blog post](https://carolined350.github.io/carolined350/2020/11/20/grant-process-1.html), I discussed the development of my project through research and the Environmental Scan. Since that post, I have written the Grant Narrative and Budget, finalized my CV, and created a mock-up of my project. These elements have allowed me to develop a vision for my project. The Grant Narrative required me to consider the digital (and physical) material I need to create my project. Before researching my options, I knew very little about mapping software or hosting a domain. In developing an effective Grant Narrative, I developed knowledge regarding such digital resources. Further, creating a Budget allowed me to recognize why it is necessary to apply for grants. Digital software is expensive!

An additional development mentioned but not yet discussed is the mock-up of my project. After writing about the various features of the project in my Grant Narrative, I was excited to see what the map could look like. Because I have not formally engaged with the mapping softwares ([Omeka](https://omeka.org) and [Neatline](https://neatline.org)) recognized in my Grant Narrative, I utilized Canva to create a mock-up. [Canva](https://www.canva.com) is a free graphic design platform that I have worked with previously. I created an image of my project that includes a part of the travel map and an example of the text that corresponds with each location.

Developing a mock-up allowed me to recognize other features that I could add to my project. If I created this project, I would make it so users could clearly read the name of each city and see a picture of the city when dragging the mouse over a specific location. I would also add a second map. This map would utilize arrows and other visual elements to explain the direction and timeline for the spread of psychology. While I originally thought creating a mock-up would be only minimally beneficial, I actually found it to be fun and useful!

Creating the final elements of the project lent to development beyond visual features. Compiling the various parts of the grant has allowed me to better understand my project's critical apparatus and purpose. By creating a map of William James’s travels, I am presenting information regarding the various aspects of William James and psychology in a single, interactive source. The map is serving greater functions as well; it's establishing the spread of psychology and building a bridge between Digital Humanities and behavioral science. 

The various elements of the grant have enabled development of different parts of my project. As mentioned in my last [blog post](https://carolined350.github.io/carolined350/2020/11/20/grant-process-1.html), the Environmental Scan allowed me to better understand mapping projects as a whole and some of the available sources regarding William James. In this post, I explained how the Grant Narrative, Budget, and mock-up allowed me to develop the visual elements as well as the critical apparatus of my project. As a whole, the grant project added to my knowledge of grant writing and Digital Humanities projects.
